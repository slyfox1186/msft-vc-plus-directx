# What is this?
These installers are the all-in-one offline version's meaning they contain all the packages associated
   with the types of files they install.

# Why should I install this?
Windows PC's rely (in some instances heavily) on Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes along with DirexctX to operate many
   different types of programs (such as but not limited to games).

# Instructions
To install run the file "RunMe.bat" with administrator privileges (right click the file and select run as administrator)

# Notes
You can verify if the installation is working by opening task manager>details tab and then filter by CPU usage.
       You should see reasonably high cpu usage coming from each installer when they are executed and actively installing files.

# Important
It may seem like nothing is happening because the cmd.exe window is blank at times and that IS THE POINT of using a silent installer.
           It is handsfree and the screen should be blank.... so let it do it's thing and dont freak out and close the cmd.exe windo prematurely.
